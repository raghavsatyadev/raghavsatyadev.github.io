Founded in 2012, Compass provides a cloud-based end-to-end platform that empowers residential real estate agents to deliver exceptional service to their seller and buyer clients, all in service of its mission to help everyone find their place in the world.\n\nAs one of the fastest-growing technology companies in an industry of nearly $4 trillion, Compass has built a world-class engineering team operating the only end-to-end platform in the real estate industry. The platform gives Compass the edge to push the boundaries of value we can add for our customers.\n\nWe are looking for an experienced Android engineer to help Compass build a platform that makes the home buying or selling experience delightful. You will be one of the technical leaders in your immediate team. You will work with other engineers to determine how to push our platform forward, devising engineering-led initiatives that ensure we can work quickly and efficiently while maintaining a high standard of operational excellence. Your work will prepare the platform for the future of Real Estate. It will enable present and future engineers to take new projects from idea to completion, directly making an impact in our customers’ day-to-day lives.\n\nOur teams are small, start-up-like, and entrepreneurial, where we value every engineer’s input. We collaborate closely with various engineering partners to take projects from idea to done with a high degree of autonomy and ownership. You will be responsible for understanding requirements and the customer problems they are aiming to solve, distilling them into manageable subparts that can be divided across other engineers on the project.\n\nDuring a project’s execution, you will act as a leader ensuring any technical questions are considered pragmatically and trade offs considered, with a well-reasoned and understood solution being executed upon. You will guide and act as a mentor for more junior engineers through technical problems, ensuring that they follow best practices from an engineering and operational excellence perspective. You will help them grow from both a technical and career perspective.

You will hear back from Compass within a week, even if you are not a good fit.\n2.  Right after you’ll get an invite to a technical screening interview. This is done by a Compass partner with night and weekend availability, low pressure redo opportunity, paired with a seasoned engineer and objective interview, reducing bias.\n3.  The main loop of interviews is as follows, each interview takes about 60 minutes with 10 minutes reserved at the end so that you can ask questions (we think it’s important that you get to know us too). These interviews are done by Compass Engineers:\n\n-   Main Coding interview\n-   System design interview\n-   Tech deep dive & cultural fit\n\n  \n\n**Compass offers flexible work environment and benefits package:**\n\n  \n\n-   100% remote work (Flexible around US time zones)\n-   USD fixed monthly compensation (through Deel)\n-   Paid local national holidays\n-   Autonomy in managing delivery of your assignments and time off\n-   Mac equipment provided\n\n  \n\nWe aims to move fast, the entire process **should not take more than 2 weeks**.\n\n  \n\n  \n\nCheck out Compass’s Engineering blog!",

    "description": "It’s 1813 and Humphrey Davy is dazzling London with scientific demonstrations and lectures. Soon enters the young bookbinder, Michael Faraday, dissatisfied with his own prospects and enamored by the mysteries of electricity. Faraday gets a break and gains an apprenticeship with Davy, and shortly thereafter (partially) blows himself and Davy up in a nitrogen trichloride explosion.  \n  \nWe think Davy’s sacrifice was worth it, though, since Faraday went on to do experimental work in the field of electromagnetism that is foundational to innumerable modern technologies. While we can’t promise you’ll become the next Faraday, we can promise you won’t be asked to deal with explosives on the job.  \n  \nInstead, you’ll be receiving mentorship from experienced mobile engineers (iOS and Android), writing Swift/Kotlin (maybe some TypeScript code), and contributing to a product that serves over 100,000 businesses. Check out demo.mercury.com to see our product for yourself.  \n  \nAll Engineering Interns, regardless of the specific role, should:  \n  \n\n-   Be interested in continually honing their craft.\n-   Have curiosity and be willing to share their perspective.\n-   Appreciate quality in their work and that of others.\n-   Communicate well, and be able to write clear explanations of their reasoning on technical decisions.\n\nYou’ll be joining as a Mobile Engineering Intern; we’d like to see folks who’ve got existing experience with _native_ iOS or Android apps (no React Native, sorry!) and might have some interest in working on some mobile-related full-stack tooling. More specifically, you can expect to:  \n  \n\n-   Join a small-but-mighty team of experienced iOS and Android engineers (and one backend dev!) – the team has been making apps for over a decade and we’re pretty darn good at it.\n-   Work closely with designers to ship a beautiful app – they love to collaborate on getting the details right; plus, many of our customers are startups and appreciate our thoughtful, polished designs.\n-   Feel a strong sense of product ownership and actively seek responsibility – we often self-organize on small/medium projects, and we want someone who’s excited to lay their own vision atop our foundation and make a big impact across the mobile team and Mercury as a whole.\n-   Have a possible interest in other parts of our stack (Android: Kotlin/Compose; iOS: UIKit/SwiftUI/RxSwift; Frontend: TypeScript/React; Backend: Haskell).\n-   Have existing experience in either/both iOS or Android, using UIKit/SwiftUI (iOS) or Jetpack Compose (Android)\n\nThis is a paid full-time remote summer internship for 12-16 weeks between May - September. Our internship program is intended for individuals enrolled in an academic program (undergraduate, graduate, etc.). Individuals interested but not enrolled in an academic program at this time are encouraged to apply to any of our full-time openings.  \n  \nIn terms of compensation, the hourly rate for candidates based in the US is $55. The hourly rate for candidates based in Canada is CAD 55.  \n  \nApplications close on February 7th, 2025. Please apply only to the single intern position that best aligns with your qualifications and interests.  \n  \nWe use Covey as part of our hiring and / or promotional process for jobs in NYC and certain features may qualify it as an AEDT. As part of the evaluation process we provide Covey with job requirements and candidate submitted applications. We began using Covey Scout for Inbound on January 22, 2024.

    "description": "Since we opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely, and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together.\n\n  \n\nSo we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, offer buy now, pay later functionality,  book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.\n\n  \n\nToday, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a significant, meaningful, and lasting business, and we are helping sellers worldwide do the same.\n\n  \n\n**The Role**\n\n  \n\nThe Onboarding team is responsible for the experiences within our mobile apps that help establish our Sellers identity with the product we provide and support them as issues arise.

Soon enters the young bookbinder, Michael Faraday, dissatisfied with his own prospects and enamored by the mysteries of electricity. Faraday gets a break and gains an apprenticeship with Davy, and shortly thereafter (partially) blows himself and Davy up in a nitrogen trichloride explosion.  \n  \nWe think Davy’s sacrifice was worth it, though, since Faraday went on to do experimental work in the field of electromagnetism that is foundational to innumerable modern technologies. While we can’t promise you’ll become the next Faraday, we can promise you won’t be asked to deal with explosives on the job.  \n  \nInstead, you’ll be receiving mentorship from experienced mobile engineers (iOS and Android), writing Swift/Kotlin (maybe some TypeScript code), and contributing to a product that serves over 100,000 businesses. Check out demo.mercury.com to see our product for yourself.  \n  \nAll Engineering Interns, regardless of the specific role, should:  \n  \n\n-   Be interested in continually honing their craft.\n-   Have curiosity and be willing to share their perspective.\n-   Appreciate quality in their work and that of others.\n-   Communicate well, and be able to write clear explanations of their reasoning on technical decisions.\n\nYou’ll be joining as a Mobile Engineering Intern; we’d like to see folks who’ve got existing experience with _native_ iOS or Android apps (no React Native, sorry!) and might have some interest in working on some mobile-related full-stack tooling. More specifically, you can expect to:  \n  \n\n-   Join a small-but-mighty team of experienced iOS and Android engineers (and one backend dev!) – the team has been making apps for over a decade and we’re pretty darn good at it.\n-   Work closely with designers to ship a beautiful app – they love to collaborate on getting the details right; plus, many of our customers are startups and appreciate our thoughtful, polished designs.\n-   Feel a strong sense of product ownership and actively seek responsibility – we often self-organize on small/medium projects, and we want someone who’s excited to lay their own vision atop our foundation and make a big impact across the mobile team and Mercury as a whole.\n-   Have a possible interest in other parts of our stack (Android: Kotlin/Compose; iOS: UIKit/SwiftUI/RxSwift; Frontend: TypeScript/React; Backend: Haskell).\n-   Have existing experience in either/both iOS or Android, using UIKit/SwiftUI (iOS) or Jetpack Compose (Android)\n\nThis is a paid full-time remote summer internship for 12-16 weeks between May - September. Our internship program is intended for individuals enrolled in an academic program (undergraduate, graduate, etc.). Individuals interested but not enrolled in an academic program at this time are encouraged to apply to any of our full-time openings.  \n  \nIn terms of compensation, the hourly rate for candidates based in the US is $55. The hourly rate for candidates based in Canada is CAD 55.  \n  \nApplications close on February 7th, 2025. Please apply only to the single intern position that best aligns with your qualifications and interests.  \n  \nWe use Covey as part of our hiring and / or promotional process for jobs in NYC and certain features may qualify it as an AEDT. As part of the evaluation process we provide Covey with job requirements and candidate submitted applications. We began using Covey Scout for Inbound on January 22, 2024.

More specifically, you can expect to:  \n  \n\n-   Join a small-but-mighty team of experienced iOS and Android engineers (and one backend dev!) – the team has been making apps for over a decade and we’re pretty darn good at it.\n-   Work closely with designers to ship a beautiful app – they love to collaborate on getting the details right; plus, many of our customers are startups and appreciate our thoughtful, polished designs.\n-   Feel a strong sense of product ownership and actively seek responsibility – we often self-organize on small/medium projects, and we want someone who’s excited to lay their own vision atop our foundation and make a big impact across the mobile team and Mercury as a whole.\n-   Have a possible interest in other parts of our stack (Android: Kotlin/Compose; iOS: UIKit/SwiftUI/RxSwift; Frontend: TypeScript/React; Backend: Haskell).\n-   Have existing experience in either/both iOS or Android, using UIKit/SwiftUI (iOS) or Jetpack Compose (Android)\n\nThis is a paid full-time remote summer internship for 12-16 weeks between May - September. Our internship program is intended for individuals enrolled in an academic program (undergraduate, graduate, etc.). Individuals interested but not enrolled in an academic program at this time are encouraged to apply to any of our full-time openings.  \n  \nIn terms of compensation, the hourly rate for candidates based in the US is $55. The hourly rate for candidates based in Canada is CAD 55.  \n  \nApplications close on February 7th, 2025. Please apply only to the single intern position that best aligns with your qualifications and interests.  \n  \nWe use Covey as part of our hiring and / or promotional process for jobs in NYC and certain features may qualify it as an AEDT. As part of the evaluation process we provide Covey with job requirements and candidate submitted applications. We began using Covey Scout for Inbound on January 22, 2024. Please see the independent bias audit report covering our use of Covey here.",

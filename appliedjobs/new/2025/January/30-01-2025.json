 \n\n**◯仕事内容◯**\n\n**＜業務詳細＞**\n\n■Androidチーム（kintone）\n\nkintoneは表計算ソフトよりも快適に、専門システムより柔軟に、自社でシステムを開発するよりスピーディーかつ低コストに、「サクッと」思いついた業務改善をすぐに実行できるサービスです。\n\n現在までに25,000社以上の導入実績があり、あらゆる業種の仕事がkintoneによって変わってきました。\n\nkintoneのAndroidアプリでは通知の確認や営業の商談報告、店舗や工事現場などの写真を添付した状況報告などオフィス外でも時間と場所を選ばずにPCと同等の業務を行えます。\n\n  \n\nkintoneのAndroidチームは、kintoneの目指す「現場が主体となって業務改善や業務の変化に対し継続的に挑戦できる組織づくりを提供する」や「プロダクトを長期的に継続提供する」という製品ビジョンに基づきに活動しています。\n\nPC版と同等の機能を提供しつつ、一部機能はネイティブアプリ機能で提供して、より多くの組織のより多くのユーザーの業務改善サイクルにとって価値のあるアプリを目指しています。\n\n

 \n\n**＜募集背景＞**\n\nkintoneのAndroidアプリは初期リリースから5年以上が経ちます。\n\nリリース当時と比べるとAndroidアプリ開発を取り巻く環境や技術は格段に進歩していますが、kintoneアプリが採用している設計思想や技術スタックについてはあまりアップデート出来ていないのが実情です。\n\n今後はよりスピーディーかつ長期的に安定して価値を提供出来るアプリ開発をするために、前述したような技術的な課題改善の取り組みや、よりモダンな技術の導入検討・推進を一緒に取り組んで頂ける仲間を募集しています。\n\n

    "description": "Since we opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely, and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together.  \n  \nSo we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, offer buy now, pay later functionality, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.  \n  \nToday, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a significant, meaningful, and lasting business, and we are helping sellers worldwide do the same.  \n  \n**The Role**  \n  \nThe Checkout team at Square has a mission to help sellers make and close sales anywhere and anyhow buyers want to buy.

    "description": "As a Software Engineer III (Frontend), you will be responsible for collaborating with product, design, and operations teams to enhance application performance and maintain high code quality. You will build and test software components, contribute to the overall project lifecycle, and ensure optimized solutions in a health tech space.\n\nSummary Generated by Built In\n\n**What we want to accomplish and why we need you**\n\nSuki is creating a new category in the health tech space – the digital assistant. We are going to be the voice user interface for healthcare. What does that mean? Currently, doctors use their electronic medical record system to track patient encounters (a digital version of the old paper charts you used to see in your doctor's office and on TV). These systems can be hard to navigate and very time consuming to manage – time that doctors would rather have to spend with their patients. This is the problem we're solving right now! Doctors that use Suki already spend over 50% less time on administrative tasks and we're striving to do even better.\n\nWe are creating engaging product experiences, building applications and services that delight and empower doctors with experiences that they could never imagine with their health IT systems. We're a team of technologists, clinicians, and industry experts working together to push the limits on technology used in medicine and even how medicine is practiced.  We’re a GCP shop and 100% container run using Kubernetes.  Our tech stack includes C++, Golang, Python, React, React Native, Swift, Android, Java, Kotlin, GraphQL and JavaScript.\n\n**What will you do everyday?**\n\nWe are looking for a Software Engineer III-Frontend to join our Application Development team.\n\n**Specifically, you will be:**\n\n-   Be a general athlete that can flex between front-end, back-end and whatever else needs your attention. \n-   Collaborating with the product, design and operations teams to build a world class product\n-   Ensure application performance, uptime, and maintaining high standards of code quality\n-   Creating unit and integration tests for written software code\n-   Providing technical expertise for every phase of the project lifecycle; from concept development to solution design, implementation, optimization and support.\n-   Drives the performance tuning, re-design and re-factoring for a module.\n-   Contributes to designing and implementing the build, release process as well as system configuration and deployment characteristics of the application.\n-   Implements (hands-on) the module components based on prevailing Framework and Open-source standards & its best practices.\n-   Responsible to prepare the technical design of the components \n\n**Ok, you're sold, but what are we looking for in the perfect candidate?**\n\n-   **Humility:** You’re humble and love working in a team without ego to deliver products\n-   **Expertise:** You know how to code.  You understand our tech stack and can be productive with it. In other words, you’ve done this before.\n-   **Action oriented:** You love to build.  You know that perfect is the enemy of the good – you like to ship fast and quickly iterate.\n-   **Creativity:** You enjoy listening to user feedback and then building products in novel ways. You’re resourceful and enjoy finding alternate paths to success.\n-   **Problem solving**: You use data to help point you in the correct direction.  You optimize relentlessly.  You think business and engineering problems are like puzzles and you stick with them until they are solved.\n-   **Adaptability:**  You thrive in a fast-moving organisation that uses light-weight processes and cutting-edge technology to have a huge impact.\n-   **Confidence**: You trust your abilities and you’re ready to push yourself to the next level.\n\n**Qualifications**\n\n-   More than 5 years of strong product development experience\n-   Proficiency in front end technologies such as React.js, Typescript, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Node.js\n-   Superior organisation, written/verbal communication, interpersonal and leadership skills\n-   Ability to collaborate effectively with cross functional teams to solve complex problems and building products spanning across geographically distributed teams to deliver end-to-end products & features\n\nRequirements is such a strong word. We don’t necessarily expect to find a candidate that has done everything we’ve listed, but you should be able to make a credible case that you’ve done most of it and are ready for the challenge of adding some new things to your resume.\n\n****Working at Suki:  \n**  \n**Our hybrid model offers the perfect balance of in-office collaboration and remote flexibility which includes three days in the office (Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday) and two days work from home (Thursday and Friday).The role is located in Bangalore and will require working from office three days a week.\n\n**Tell me more about Suki**\n\n-   **On a roll:** Named by Fast Company as one of the most innovative companies, named Google’s Partner of the Year for AI/ML, named by Forbes as one of the top 50 companies in AI .\n-   **Great team:** Founded, managed, and backed by successful tech veterans from Google and Apple and medical leaders from UCSF and Stanford. We have technologists and doctors working side-by-side to solve complex problems.\n-   **Great investors:** We’re backed by Venrock, First Round Capital, Flare Capital, March Capital, Hedosophia and others. With our $165M raised so far, we have the resources to scale.\n-   **Huge market:** Disrupting a massive, growing $30+ billion market for transcription, dictation, and order-entry solutions. Our vision is to become _the_ voice user interface for healthcare, relieving the administrative burden on doctors instead of adding to it.\n-   **Great customers:** Our solutions are used in health systems and clinics across the country, supporting clinicians across dozens of specialties.  Check out what one of our users says about how Suki has helped his practice.\n-   **Impact:** You’ll make an impact from day one. You’ll join a team working towards a shared purpose with a culture built upon deep empathy for doctors and passion for making their lives better. \n\nSuki is an Equal Opportunity Employer.

    "description": "**What we want to accomplish and why we need you**  \n  \nSuki is creating a new category in the health tech space – the digital assistant. We are going to be the voice user interface for healthcare. What does that mean? Currently, doctors use their electronic medical record system to track patient encounters (a digital version of the old paper charts you used to see in your doctor’s office and on TV). These systems can be hard to navigate and very time consuming to manage. Time that doctors would rather have to spend with their patients. We are creating the solution, come and join us! Doctors that use Suki already spend over 50% less time on administrative tasks and we’re striving to do even better.  \n  \nWe are a product driven company. We have one product running as a single service and we’re focused on making that world class. We’re confident enough to move fast and talented enough not to break things. We’re a GCP shop and 100% container run using Kubernetes. Our tech stack includes Golang, Python, React, React Native, Swift, Android, Java, Kotlin, GraphQL and JavaScript.  \n  \n**What will you do everyday?**  \n  \nYou’ll create engaging product experiences on iOS/Android and services that delight and empower doctors with experiences that they could never imagine with their health IT systems. You have an equal grasp of iOS and Android native development expertise in Swift/Objective-C/Kotlin/Java. You will work with the product, design and operations team to build the best product and support it. You will be DevOps friendly and you will write, test and deploy your own code. While you know how to work hard, you also know how to have fun at work, make friends with your colleagues and contribute to our diverse and inclusive culture. You will also contribute to making doctors’ lives better by reducing the administrative burden they face every day.
